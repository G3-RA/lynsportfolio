    <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet â€” a space where curiosity meets creativity. Iâ€™m currently a full-time learner with a soft spot for meaningful design, hands-on crafts, and storytelling through journaling. When Iâ€™m not immersed in a tech internship or scribbling in one of my many journals, Iâ€™m usually dreaming up something new to make, explore, or share. Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to click around and get to know me better. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨</p>
